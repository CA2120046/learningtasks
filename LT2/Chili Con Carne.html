        <p>This     was     one     of     the     first     easy
recipes    I    learnt    to    cook    and    can    be
mastered    in    just    a    few    attempts!    It’s
healthy,    cheap    and    tasty    and    makes
the    ultimate    student    food.    You    can
make    a    large    batch    of    this    and    then
store    in    the    fridge    for    days    or    freeze
for    weeks.    </p>
