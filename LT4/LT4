            and that I played too much video games,<br>
            Then I realized my bad habit and my addiction,<br>
            I decided to stop because I feared of losing you.</br>

          <p class="font-two">So I went by your place to tell you the good news,<br>
             but instead I found you in the arms of someone new.</br>

          <p class="font-three">I turned back and went home, <br>
            sat on my chair and placed my hands on my mouse and keyboard,<br>
            I guess it really is time to stop my bad habit.</br>

          <p class="font-four">You."
